# Software Engineer Resume Template
This repo consists of a modularized latex resume template that I use for applying software engineer positions, which is inspired by my seniors. The template is designed to be simple and clean, with a focus on the content. The template is modularized, so you can easily add or remove sections as needed (according to your job description).

The template is for your reference only. Feel free to change anything as there is no standard answer on what is a good resume.
